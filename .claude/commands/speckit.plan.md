$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before planning)**:
- Check if `.claude/specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_plan` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.claude/specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.claude/specify/scripts/powershell/setup-plan.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.claude/specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Approach as 2-3 paragraphs of prose describing how technologies interact, where code runs, and how data flows. Do NOT use key-value metadata lists.
   - Fill Architecture Decisions — one subsection per key technical choice with Decision/Rationale/Alternatives rejected. If a constitution violation must be justified, do it inline in the relevant decision's rationale.
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Fill Project Structure with concrete file paths being created or modified — no generic placeholder trees or option blocks
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all unknowns)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

5. **Check for extension hooks**: After reporting, check if `.claude/specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
   - If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_plan` key
   - If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
   - Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
   - For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
     - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
     - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
   - For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
     - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
       ```
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Optional Hook**: {extension}
       Command: `/{command}`
       Description: {description}

       Prompt: {prompt}
       To execute: `/{command}`
       ```
     - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
       ```
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
       Executing: `/{command}`
       EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
       ```
   - If no hooks are registered or `.claude/specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Identify unknowns** from the feature spec and existing codebase:
   - Technology choices that need validation → research task
   - Integration patterns between components → patterns task
   - Architecture trade-offs that need analysis → decision task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown or technology choice:
     Task: "Research {topic} for {feature context}"
   For each architecture trade-off:
     Task: "Compare approaches for {decision} — evaluate {option A} vs {option B}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

4. **Fill plan sections** using research findings:
   - Write Technical Approach as prose (2-3 paragraphs, no key-value metadata)
   - Write Architecture Decisions with Decision/Rationale/Alternatives rejected per entry
   - Fill Project Structure with concrete file paths only

**Output**: research.md with all unknowns resolved, plan.md Technical Approach and Architecture Decisions filled

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Define interface contracts** (if project has external interfaces) → `/contracts/`:
   - Identify what interfaces the project exposes to users or other systems
   - Document the contract format appropriate for the project type
   - Examples: public APIs for libraries, command schemas for CLI tools, endpoints for web services, grammars for parsers, UI contracts for applications
   - Skip if project is purely internal (build scripts, one-off tools, etc.)

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.claude/specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications
